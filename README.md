# ML-Project Random-Forest-Hotel-Cancellation-Prediction
## Project Description:

- In this particular project, we are using the Hotel_Booking dataset that contains information like hotel, meal, country, meal, adult, children deposit type etc and using that to predict the chances of cancellation.
- However, before you go ahead and make predictions, it is advised that you first pre-process and study the data, since it may contain some irregularities and noise.

## Project code explanation:
- **Loaded dataset using Pandas** and explored unique values for all columns.  
- **Handled missing values** by checking for nulls and applying appropriate imputation techniques.  
- **Encoded categorical variables** using **Label Encoder** for numerical representation.  
- **Split data into training and testing sets** using **Train-Test Split** for model evaluation.  
- **Applied Random Forest Classifier**, optimizing hyperparameters with **Randomized Search CV**.  
- **Achieved a high accuracy of 99.98%** by selecting the best model parameters.
