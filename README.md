# ML-Project Random-Forest-Hotel-Cancellation-Prediction
Project Description:

In this particular project, we are using the Hotel_Booking dataset that contains information like hotel, meal, country, meal, adult, children deposit type etc and using that to predict the chances of cancellation.
However, before you go ahead and make predictions, it is advised that you first pre-process and study the data, since it may contain some irregularities and noise.

project code explanation:
- **Loaded dataset using Pandas** and explored unique values for all columns.  
- **Handled missing values** by checking for nulls and applying appropriate imputation techniques.  
- **Encoded categorical variables** using **Label Encoder** for numerical representation.  
- **Split data into training and testing sets** using **Train-Test Split** for model evaluation.  
- **Applied Random Forest Classifier**, optimizing hyperparameters with **Randomized Search CV**.  
- **Achieved a high accuracy of 99.98%** by selecting the best model parameters.
